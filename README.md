#### 🏆 Some Things I'm Proud Of ...

  - ✅ **Agenda** : A desktop and web application designed to help university students manage their workload and keep track of their grades, tasks, events and resources. Agenda was created for my third year Individual Project (i.e., dissertation), and based on the incredibly positive feedback recieved during user trials, I have refactored it into a mobile application - **Grades** - that I am developing during my fourth year!

 - 🔍 **[CSVQL IDE]** : An IDE for the [CSVQL Programming Language]. CSVQL was a programming language I designed and wrote a compiler for to support the querying of CSV files. The CSVQL IDE supports the creation, editing and execution of CSVQL programs, and support has also been added for Java and Python programs to demonstrate the versatility of the program.
