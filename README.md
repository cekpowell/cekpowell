# Hey there!  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is **Charles Powell** and I am a fourth year MEng Computer Science student at the University of Southampton! I am from England and based in Southampton and Salisbury!


#### 🙋🏼‍♂️ My current interests ...

- 📱 Mobile, Desktop & Web Development
- ✏️ UI & UX Design
- 🧠 Machine Learning & Computer Vision
 
#### 👔 What I'm working on right now ...

- 🪧 **AutoSign** : A mobile application that supports automated inspection of signage on train vehicles using computer vision. Autosign is being developed with an industry partner - a manufacturer of train signs.

#### 🏆 Some things I'm proud of ...

  - ✅ **Agenda** : A desktop and web application designed to help university students manage their workload and keep track of their grades, tasks, events and resources. Agenda was created for my third year Individual Project (i.e., dissertation), and based on the incredibly positive feedback recieved during user trials, I have refactored it into a mobile application - **Grades** - that I am developing during my fourth year!
 
- 👍🏻 **[Recommender Systems]** : A collection of recommender systems implemented using both classical (collaborative filtering) and modern (matrix factorization) approaches.

- 🌄 **[Scene Recognition Classifiers]** : A collection of scene recognition classifiers implemented using the OpenIMAJ framework.

- 🌐 **[Distro]** : A distributed file storage system that can handle concurrent client requests and tolerates failures. The system maintains that each file is replicated across a given number of file store units, and that files are evenly distributed across units, despite failures/new units joining.

 - 🔍 **[CSVQL IDE]** : An IDE for the [CSVQL Programming Language]. CSVQL was a programming language I designed and wrote a compiler for to support the querying of CSV files. The CSVQL IDE supports the creation, editing and execution of CSVQL programs, and support has also been added for Java and Python programs to demonstrate the versatility of the program.
